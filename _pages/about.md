Hey there, first of all thanks for checking my website :). I'm Jos√© Alfredo, originally from Guadalajara Jalisco in Mexico. I'm currently a Ph.D. student in atmospheric science at Purdue University, working with [Dan Chavas](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~dchavas/). My scientific interests are in Tropical climate and tropical dynamics, particularly Tropical Cyclones and Monsoon systems. I'm also a foodie, and I love to see food (and languages!) as a window towards other cultures and to express ourselves in an easier (and delicious) way. 

First Manuscript submitted to GRL!

My First project during at Purdue was related to Eastern North Pacific Tropical Cyclone landfalls. We found that: 1) The Eastern North Pacific seasonal cycle has a bimodal distribution of tropical cyclone landfalls due to its orography. 2) During high landfall years, tropical cyclones make landfall in vulnerable Southern Mexico due to a stronger reversal of the easterlies. And 3) The steering wind anomalies are the main driver for landfall interannual variability in the East Pacific.
