Hey there, first of all thanks for checking my website :) <br>
I'm Jos√© Alfredo, originally from Guadalajara Jalisco in Mexico. I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in atmospheric science at Purdue University, working with [Dan Chavas](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~dchavas/). My scientific interests are in Tropical climate and tropical dynamics, particularly Tropical Cyclones and Monsoon systems. I'm also a foodie, and I love to see food (and languages!) as a window towards other cultures and to express ourselves in an easier (and delicious) way. 

NEWS
======

Passed my preliminary exam (May 2025)!
======

I passed my preliminary exam, presentation titled: "Climatolofy of ITCZ Breakdown Events and Their Impact on East Pacific Tropical Cyclogenesis", so expect some ITCZ TC genesis science in the comming months/years :)

First Manuscript Accepted to GRL (April 2025)!
======
My First project at Purdue was related to Eastern North Pacific Tropical Cyclone landfalls. We found that: 1) The Eastern North Pacific seasonal cycle has a bimodal distribution of tropical cyclone landfalls due to its orography. 2) During high landfall years, tropical cyclones make landfall in vulnerable Southern Mexico due to a stronger reversal of the easterlies. And 3) The steering wind anomalies are the main driver for landfall interannual variability in the East Pacific. You can read it [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL113807)
